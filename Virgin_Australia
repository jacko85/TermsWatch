   We also provide specific privacy collection notices relating to our
   particular services and practices (“Privacy Statements”). Access our
   current Privacy Statements.

   We will update our Privacy Policy if the way we handle personal
   information changes or as required by law.  Updates to our Privacy
   Policy will be published on our website.

2. Collecting your personal information

   2.1 Types of information we collect

   The personal information that we collect will depend on your
   relationship with us and the service you have requested. It may
   include:
     * your identity and contact details including; name, address, email
       address, phone number, date of birth, gender, passport or other
       identification details and photograph;
     * payment information in connection with a flight or cargo booking or
       additional products or services purchased during your flight or
       through our website or our Contact Centre;
     * itinerary and other travel related information (including any
       dietary and special assistance requirements);
     * IP address or MAC address when using our website or mobile
       applications (and other associated details, including the city
       associated with your IP or MAC address, the date and time of your
       visit to our website, pages viewed, the URL of the website that you
       viewed before our website and the type of browser you use);
     * if you use social media, any information that you allow the social
       media site to share with us;
     * Velocity Frequent Flyer membership information;
     * your feedback and opinions about our products and services
     * information relating to your dealings with us, including insights
       about you so that we can better understand your preferences and
       interests; and
     * information in relation to your past or current employer if you
       apply for a job with us, travel under your employers account or
       interact with us on behalf of your employer.

   2.2 Collecting health and other sensitive information
   We may collect information about you which is considered sensitive
   under applicable privacy and data protection laws. This information may
   include:
     * information in relation to your health if relevant to your travel
       with us, for example if you make a Special Assistance request or a
       meal request indicative of a medical condition or food intolerance,
       we are required to determine your fitness to fly, or where you are
       involved in a safety investigation, accident, complaint or claim;
       and
     * religious beliefs where you make a meal request indicative of a
       particular religion (e.g., halal or kosher).

   See paragraph 7 “Job Applicants” for information in relation to the
   sensitive information that we may collect when you apply for a job with
   us.

   Generally, we will ask for your consent to handle your health or other
   sensitive information or, in certain circumstances, you will consent to
   our collection by providing your health or other sensitive information
   to us.  We may also handle your health or other sensitive information
   on other legal grounds, including to comply with our legal obligations,
   to protect your interests (where you are not capable of giving your
   consent), where it is in the public interest and in relation to legal
   claims.

   We will not use your health or other sensitive information for
   marketing purposes.

   2.3 Anonymity

   Where possible, we will allow you to interact with us anonymously or
   using a pseudonym. For example, if you contact our Guest Contact Centre
   with a general enquiry, you may choose not to provide your name unless
   we need it to adequately handle your enquiry. However, for most of our
   functions and activities we usually need your name and contact
   information.

   2.4 How we collect personal information

   We collect your personal information in a number of ways. We may
   collect your personal information directly from you or in the course of
   our dealings with you, for example when you:
     * provide personal information to us, for example, when you make or
       update a booking, subscribe to our email or other communications,
       enter a competition, provide feedback to us or otherwise interact
       with us;
     * visit our website, social media channels or mobile applications;
     * apply for a position with us;
     * complete a form for us, such as medical clearance, claim and
       unaccompanied minor forms;
     * contact our Contact Centre. We record all calls in and out of our
       Contact Centre and so we will collect any personal information you
       provide during the call; or
     * register as a travel industry or corporate travel partner.

   We may also collect personal information about you from other people or
   organisations. This may include our related entities and:
     * a person who makes, changes or enquires about a flight, cargo or
       other booking on your behalf or who otherwise interacts with us on
       your behalf (such as a family member, travel or booking agents,
       sales agents or your employer or other representative as part of a
       corporate or group booking);
     * recruitment agencies and previous employers, if you have applied
       for a position with us and with your consent;
     * our service providers and contractors (such as ground handlers,
       cargo handlers, call centre operators, third parties that provide
       us with services under a white label arrangement, marketing
       agencies, data analytics and market research providers and sales
       agencies, payment fulfilment and fraud protection providers and
       organisations that issue a Virgin Australia Cargo Air Waybill for
       the carriage of cargo);
     * our airline and non-airline partners, including other airlines
       listed on your itinerary, car rental providers, hoteliers, airport
       transfer and parking providers, travel insurance providers and
       foreign exchange services;
     * third parties who conduct market research or run competitions and
       other promotions on our behalf or for which we are the sponsor; and
     * government agencies and regulatory authorities, including
       immigration and border security and police, and airport security.

   We may combine and compare personal information that we hold about you
   with other information collected from, or held by, others. We do this
   to better understand your interests and preferences, which helps us to
   enhance your experience. More information about why we do this is
   provided under ‘Why we collect personal information’.

   2.5 Why we collect personal information

   We collect your personal information for a variety of purposes and on
   different legal grounds. Most of the time, we collect your personal
   information so that we can provide you with our services and any
   products that you may have requested and to enter into and perform our
   contract with you. This may include:
     * processing and making arrangements for flight, cargo or other
       bookings and any additional products or services requested during
       the booking process;
     * arranging frequent flyer program recognition and benefits in
       relation to your booking;
     * verifying your identity;
     * communicating with you before and after your flight, including to
       provide flight updates; and
     * determining or handling issues of passenger safety, security and
       other requirements, including special assistance requirements and
       medical fitness to fly.

   Some information is collected and handled for purposes that you've
   consented to. This may include:
     * identifying and arranging benefits for you with our airline and
       non-airline partners, including frequent flyer program recognition
       and benefits, complimentary membership and discounts, where you
       have asked us to do this;
     * providing, operating and contacting you in relation to our market
       and consumer research activities, competitions, promotions and
       events, where you have told us that you would like to take part in
       these;
     * contacting you with marketing and promotional material about our
       offers or promotions, and those of our related entities, airline
       and non-airline partners and other third parties; and
     * collecting your health or other sensitive information.

   At other times, we collect your personal information to carry out our
   functions and activities because we have a legitimate business interest
   in handling your information for these functions and activities. This
   may include:
     * to develop insights about you so that we can better understand your
       preferences and interests. We do this to identify products,
       services that may be of interest to you, personalise your
       experience and enhance the products and services offered by us, our
       related entities and our airline and non-airline partners. In these
       cases, both we and these third parties have an interest in
       researching and analysing the services our customers want and
       personalising our offers so we're better able to provide products
       and services that are relevant to you. We may also use trusted
       service providers to undertake the process of creating these
       insights; and
     * to help us continuously improve the services and products we offer
       and respond to your feedback, queries and complaints.

   We also collect your personal information to comply with legal, audit,
   reporting, record-keeping and investigation requirements and for
   operational and regulatory compliance purposes.

   2.6 Decisions that we make automatically about you

   We may make completely automated decisions on certain matters. For
   example, we (including service providers acting on our behalf, such as
   those who provide data analysis and business intelligence services) may
   assess existing or potential customers' interest in us and our and
   related products/services by logging your interaction with us via our
   website, our advertisements, the submission of forms or the number of
   "clicks" that you make on emails that we send you. In certain
   circumstances, we disclose this information to our trusted partners.
   The outcome of these activities will help us and our trusted partners
   to develop insights about you and better understand your preferences
   and interests. We and our partners may make marketing decisions about
   you based on these insights.

   2.7 What would happen if we did not collect your personal information?

   If we cannot collect your personal information as described above, we
   may not be able to process your flight, cargo or other booking, or your
   special assistance, medical clearance or other requests. We also may
   not be able to fully investigate an incident, complaint or claim, or
   provide you with all or some of our other products and services.
   You may not need to provide some of the information that we use on the
   basis of our legitimate interests. For example, you can disable cookies
   in your browser.

   described in ‘Why we collect your personal information’.

       promotions and prize fulfilments services, marketing and
       advertising services, data analysis, market research and business
       intelligence services, payment fulfilment and fraud protection
       services and security services;
     * to third parties providing digital or other technology services
       (including digital assistants that utilise voice, virtual and other
       technology), where you have authorised the third party to receive
       information that we hold about you;
     * in the event of an emergency or other serious incident, to
       government departments/officials and agencies, support

       providers for security, customs and immigration purposes.

   If we need to handle your information for any other purpose, we will
   only do so with your consent or where you may otherwise reasonably
   expect us to do so.

4 How long do we keep your personal information?

   We will keep your personal information for as long as we reasonably
   require your personal information for any valid and lawful purpose.
   These purposes include to provide you with our services and any
   products that you have requested, exercise our rights and perform our
   obligations under a contract, investigate and defend actual or
   potential claims, comply with our legal obligations and other purposes
   permitted by law.
   When it is no longer reasonably necessary for us to keep your personal
   information, your information will be destroyed or put beyond use.
   However, we may de-identify data and retain such data for statistical
   purposes only.

5 Travelling with others, corporate accounts and government travel

   If your booking contains more than one guest (whether you and your
   family or a friend, or a group booking for 10 or more) or you are
   travelling under a corporate account, then we will collect your
   personal information from you or the person who made or updated the
   booking on your behalf. We may also disclose your personal information
   to the person who made or updated your booking and other persons
   included in the booking.

   If your booking is made through your employer’s corporate travel
   agreement or through a government travel agreement (or for official
   government purposes) with Virgin Australia, we may collect your
   personal information from and disclose your personal information to
   your employer / relevant government body (or their representative),
   including your itinerary, information relating to your travel including
   check-in, “no-show” or boarding status and any incident reports.

6 Overseas disclosures

   We are based in Australia, so your personal information will be
   processed in Australia. However, we may disclose your personal
   information to organisations or persons located outside of Australia.
   The countries in which these organisations or persons are located will
   depend on the circumstances, but in the course of our ordinary
   operations, we generally disclose personal information to third parties
   located in the countries where:
     * you are travelling to or from or you are sending cargo to or from
       (including to local cargo and ground handlers, law enforcement and

       non-airline partners who are providing you with a product or
       service);
     * our third party service providers are located, including, Canada,
       Dubai, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,

       only disclose your personal information to an overseas Velocity
       Frequent Flyer Program Partner where necessary to process a
       transaction for you.

   If we disclose personal information to a third party in a country which
   does not have equivalent privacy laws to your home country, we will
   take steps to ensure that you are provided with appropriate safeguards
   in respect of your personal information. This might include entering
   into contractual clauses with the third party that place obligations on
   the third party in relation to their handling your personal
   information.

7. Job applicants

   When you apply for a job with us, we will generally collect the
   personal information that you include in your application, such as your
   contact details, career history and education details.  We may also
   collect sensitive information from you, for example, medical
   information or criminal history, if it is relevant to the role that you
   are applying for, and whether you identify as Aboriginal or Torres
   Strait Islander, for our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. We will only
   collect such sensitive personal information where you have consented to
   us doing so.

   We may also obtain personal information about you from third parties
   with your consent, for example, from your previous employers or
   nominated referees. We collect personal information for the purpose of
   assessing and progressing your application. We will hold your personal
   information for future job opportunities with us, unless you tell us
   not to.

   We may disclose your personal information to our related entities ,
   your referees and also to third party suppliers that we use to help
   with our recruitment processes, such as recruitment agencies and
   organisations that conduct competency or psychometric tests. We may
   also disclose your personal information to law enforcement agencies to
   verify whether you have a criminal record.

9 Our marketing and your personal information

   We use personal information that we hold about you to identify services
   and products that may be of interest to you.

   We may contact you by email, text message or other digital service
   (such as through our applications that you install on your device such

   personal information to our related entities and airline and
   non-airline partners to allow them to tell you about a product or
   service that may be of interest to you, based on your transactions with
   us. Our marketing agencies may also contact you using your personal
   information that they already hold, or we may provide your personal
   information to them, in order to serve you with more relevant
   advertising about our services and products.

   You can contact us at any time if you no longer wish to receive
   marketing materials from us or our related entities.  If you receive a

   of marketing email by clicking on the "Manage Preferences" link or the
   “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email. You can also manage your

   marketing communications in relation to your flights on our website.

10. Storage and security of your personal information

   10.1 Our systems

   We mostly hold personal information electronically in our IT systems
   and databases. We also hold personal information in telephone
   recordings and in hard copy paper files. We use third party service
   providers to store some personal information.

   We take reasonable steps to protect the information that we hold about
   you from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access,
   modification or disclosure.

   We do this by having physical and electronic security systems and by
   limiting who can access your personal information. We also have online
   and network security systems in place for our websites, so that the
   information you provide us online is protected and secure. However,
   because of the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee the security
   of your personal information.

   Please contact us if you become aware of any breach of security.

   10.2 Keeping your booking safe

   Your Booking Reference (located at the top of your itinerary) or your
   Velocity PIN (if you are a Velocity Frequent Flyer member) is like your
   password for your booking.

   You can help us protect your privacy by keeping your Booking Reference
   and your Velocity PIN safe. Don’t share your Booking Reference or
   Velocity PIN with any other person, unless you are happy for them to
   receive information from us about your booking and travel arrangements
   and to make changes to your booking.

   We will only update a flight booking or otherwise provide information
   in relation a booking (including passenger names, destinations, changes
   or interruptions to travel or no-shows) or provide copies of
   itineraries or tax invoices, if our verification criteria are met.

   If you believe your Booking Reference or Velocity PIN has been obtained
   by someone who you do not want to have access to your booking, please
   notify us immediately.

11. Rights in respect of your personal information

   11.1 General – access to and correction of personal data

   You have a right to request access to or correction of your personal
   information held by us.

   If you wish to access, correct or update any personal information that
   we hold about you, please contact us on the details below.  We will
   need to verify your identity before we can process your request.

   We will respond to your request within a reasonable time of you making
   the request and give you access in the manner you requested, unless it
   is unreasonable or impracticable for us to do so.

   Sometimes we will be able to respond to your query over the phone, but
   sometimes we may need your request in writing and we might need some
   time to gather the requested information and get back to you. These
   more complex requests usually take us between 14 and 30 days. We might
   need to send a copy of the information to you by post or we might ask
   you to come and see us to have a look at the information.

   Making a request is free. But depending on what information you request
   access to, we may need to charge you for giving you access to the
   information. The charges will not be excessive and we'll let you know
   if a charge will apply before we proceed with giving you access. There
   is no charge for correcting your personal information. Please note that
   if you are making a request from the European Union, your request will
   be completely free apart from in a very limited number of
   circumstances. This might include if your request is repetitive or if
   you have requested further copies of the same information. The fee will
   be based on the administrative cost of providing the information.

   There may be reasons why we cannot give you access to the information
   that you have requested, or we refuse to correct your personal
   information. If this is the case, we will let you know these reasons in
   writing. If we refuse you access or to correct your personal
   information, you can make a complaint about this, by following the
   complaint procedures in this Privacy Policy.

   If we refuse to correct your personal information that we hold, you can
   ask us to associate with that information a statement that the
   information is inaccurate, out-of-date, irrelevant or misleading.

   11.2 Specific rights for EU residents only

   If you are located in the European Union, then you may have additional
   rights. Some of these rights will only apply in very limited
   circumstances.
     * You can withdraw your consent, where we rely on it for processing
       your personal information, at any time.
     * You can ask us to confirm if we are using your personal
       information.
     * You can ask us to delete your personal information. This right only
       applies in limited circumstances and will not usually apply where
       it remains necessary for us to process your information for the
       purposes for which it was collected, we are required by law to
       retain your information or your information is relevant to a legal
       dispute.
     * You can ask us to stop or restrict how we process your personal
       information. These rights will apply in limited circumstances and
       will not usually apply when we need to process your information to
       carry out our day-to-day business functions or where we have
       compelling legitimate grounds for processing your information.
     * You can ask us to help you move your personal information to other
       companies, where this is technically possible and only if we have
       collected and used your data via automatic means. Other conditions
       apply.
     * You have the right to be informed and know about any protections
       that we have put in place when we are transferring your data
       overseas.

12. How to make a complaint

   If you have a complaint about how we have handled your personal
   information, you can make a complaint by contacting us using the
   details below.

   Once we have received your complaint, we will investigate and respond
   to you within a reasonable period of time.

   We take any privacy complaint seriously and will deal with your
   complaint fairly and promptly. However if you are not satisfied with
   our response or how we handled your complaint, you may complain to the
   Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at:

   Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)
   GPO Box 5218
   Sydney NSW 2001
   Phone: 1300 363 992
   TTY: 1800 620 241
   email: enquiries@oaic.gov.au

   If your complaint relates to our airline services (rather than being
   privacy-related), you can contact the Airline Customer Advocate, which
   provides a complaint handling and dispute resolution process for
   eligible airline customers.

   If you are located in the European Union, you have the right to
   complain to the local data protection authority within the EU. You can
   find the details of your local DPA here.
