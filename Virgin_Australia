       address, phone number,date of birth, gender, passport or other
       identification details and photograph;
     * payment information in connection with a flight or cargo booking or

       you allow the social media site to share with us;

     * your feedback and opinions about our products and services; and
     * information relating to your dealings with us, including developing
       insights about you so that we can better understand your
       preferences and interests.

2.2 Collecting health and other sensitive information

   We may collect health or other sensitive information about you:
     * if relevant to your travel arrangements, for example, where you
       make a “Special Assistance” request, provide your dietary
       requirements or otherwise provide us with health information;
     * have a medical condition and are required to complete a medical
       clearance form; or

   However, for most of our functions and activities we usually need your
   name and contact information.


2.4 How we collect personal information

   We collect your personal information in a number of ways. We may
   collect your personal information directly from you or in the course of
   our dealings with you, for example when you:
     * provide personal information to us, for example, when you make or

       with us;
     * visit our website, social media channels or mobile applications;
     * apply for a position with us;
     * complete a form for us, such as medical clearance, claim and
       unaccompanied minor forms; or
     * contact our Contact Centre. We record all calls in and out of our

       provide during the call.

   We may also collect personal information about you from other people or
   organisations. This may include our related entities and:
     * a person who makes, changes or enquires about a flight, cargo or
       other booking on your behalf or who otherwise interacts with us on

       sales agents or your employer or other representative as part of a
       corporate or group booking);
     * recruitment agencies and previous employers, if you have applied
       for a position with us and with your consent;
     * our service providers and contractors (such as ground handlers,
       cargo handlers, call centre operators, marketing agencies, data
       analytics and market research providers, sales agencies, payment
       fulfilment and fraud protection providers and organisations that
       issue a Virgin Australia Cargo Air Waybill for the carriage of
       cargo;
     * our airline and non-airline partners, including car rental
       providers, hoteliers, airport transfer and parking providers,
       travel insurance providers and foreign exchange services;
     * third parties who run competitions and other competitions on our
       behalf or for which we are the sponsor; and
     * government agencies and regulatory authorities, including
       immigration and border security and police, and airport security.

   We may combine and compare personal information that we hold about you
   with other information collected from, or held by, others. We do this
   to better understand your interests and preferences, which helps us to
   enhance your experience. More information about why we do this is
   provided under ‘Why we collect personal information’.

2.5 Why we collect personal information

   We collect your personal information so that we can provide you with
   our services and any products that you may have requested, to contact
   you and to carry out our functions and activities.

   The purposes for which we collect your personal information may
   include:
     * processing and making arrangements for your flight, cargo or other
       booking and any additional products or services you requested
       during the booking process;
     * verifying your identity;
     * communicating with you before and after your flight, including to
       provide flight updates and request your feedback;

       non-airline partners, including frequent flyer program recognition
       and benefits, complimentary membership and discounts;
     * determining issues of passenger safety, security and other
       requirements, including special assistance requirements and medical
       fitness to fly;
     * providing and operating our competitions, promotions and events;
     * contacting you with marketing and promotional material about our
       offers or promotions, and those of our related entities, airline
       and non-partners and other third parties;
     * developing insights about you so that we can better understand your
       preferences and interests. We do this to identify products,
       services that may be of interest to you, personalise your
       experience and enhance the products and services offered by us, our
       related entities and our airline and non-airline partners. We may
       also use trusted service providers to undertake the process of
       creating these insights.

9 Storage and security of your personal information

9.1 Our systems

   We mostly hold personal information electronically in our IT systems
   and databases. We also hold personal information in telephone
   recordings and in hard copy paper files. We use third party service
   providers to store some personal information.

   We take reasonable steps to protect the information that we hold about
   you from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access,
   modification or disclosure.

   We do this by having physical and electronic security systems and by
   limiting who can access your personal information. We also have online
   and network security systems in place for our websites, so that the
   information you provide us online is protected and secure. However,
   because of the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee the security
   of your personal information.

   Please contact us if you become aware of any breach of security.

9.2 Keeping your booking safe

   Your Booking Reference (located at the top of your itinerary) or your
   Velocity PIN (if you are a Velocity Frequent Flyer member) is like your
   password for your booking.

   You can help us protect your privacy by keeping your Booking Reference
   and your Velocity PIN safe. Don’t share your Booking Reference or
   Velocity PIN with any other person, unless you are happy for them to
   receive information from us about your booking and travel arrangements
   and to make changes to your booking.

   We will only update a flight booking or otherwise provide information
   in relation a booking (including passenger names, destinations, changes
   or interruptions to travel or no-shows) or provide copies of
   itineraries or tax invoices, if our verification criteria are met.

   If you believe your Booking Reference or Velocity PIN has been obtained
   by someone who you do not want to have access to your booking, please
   notify us immediately.

10 Access to and correction of your personal information

   You have a right to request access to or correction of your personal
   information held by us.

   If you wish to access, correct or update any personal information that
   we hold about you, please contact us on the details below.  We will
   need to verify your identity before we can process your request.

   We will respond to your request within a reasonable time of you making
   the request and give you access in the manner you requested, unless it
   is unreasonable or impracticable for us to do so.

   Sometimes we will be able to respond to your query over the phone, but
   sometimes we may need your request in writing and we might need some
   time to gather the requested information and get back to you. These
   more complex requests usually take us between 14 and 30 days. We might
   need to send a copy of the information to you by post or we might ask
   you to come and see us to have a look at the information.

   Making a request is free. But depending on what information you request
   access to, we may need to charge you for giving you access to the
   information. The charges will not be excessive and we'll let you know
   if a charge will apply before we proceed with giving you access. There
   is no charge for correcting your personal information.

   There may be reasons why we cannot give you access to the information
   that you have requested, or we refuse to correct your personal
   information. If this is the case, we will let you know these reasons in
   writing. If we refuse you access or to correct your personal
   information, you can make a complaint about this, by following the
   complaint procedures in this Privacy Policy.

   If we refuse to correct your personal information that we hold, you can
   ask us to associate with that information a statement that the
   information is inaccurate, out-of-date, irrelevant or misleading.
