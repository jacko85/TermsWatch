Privacy Policy

   When you trust us with your personal information, you expect us to
   protect it and keep it safe

   We are bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ('Privacy Act') and will
   protect your personal information in accordance with the Australian
   Privacy Principles. These principles govern how we can collect, use,
   hold and disclose your personal information, as well as ensuring the
   quality and security of your personal information.
   If you would like more information about how we protect your privacy,
   please contact us.

About this policy

   This privacy policy explains how we manage your personal information.
   Please refer to the Credit Reporting Policy section for information on
   our management of your credit information.


   What is personal information?

   Personal information includes any information or opinion, about an
   identified individual or an individual who can be reasonably identified
   from their information. The information or opinion will still be
   personal information whether it is true or not and regardless of
   whether we have kept a record of it.
   The information that we seek to collect about you will depend on the
   products or services that we provide. If you do not allow us to collect
   all of the information we request, we may not be able to deliver all of
   those services effectively.
   What kinds of personal information do we collect and hold?

   When you apply for our products or services we may ask for
   identification information. This could include your name, address,
   contact details and date of birth. We may also collect your tax file
   number if we are authorised to collect it and if you choose to supply
   it. If you apply for insurance, we may collect information about what
   is being insured, the beneficiaries, and your health and financial
   situation, depending on the type of insurance.
   Throughout the life of your product or service, we may collect and hold
   additional personal information about you. This could include
   transaction information or making a record of queries or complaints you
   make and, if you make an insurance claim, collecting additional
   information to assess the claim.
   The collection of sensitive information is restricted by the Privacy
   Act. This includes information about your religion, racial or ethnic
   origin, political opinions, criminal record, and sexual orientation. It
   also includes health information and biometric information.
   Generally, we only collect this sort of information if it is necessary
   to provide you with a specific product or service and you have
   consented to that collection. For example, we may collect health
   information about you to process a claim under an insurance policy or
   collect voice biometric information to verify your identity or
   authorise transactions.
   For what purposes do we collect, hold, use and disclose personal
   information?

   The main reason we collect, use, hold and disclose personal information
   is to provide you with products and services. This includes:
     * checking whether you are eligible for the product or service;
     * assisting you where online applications are not completed;
     * providing the product or service; and
     * helping manage the product or service.

   We may also use your information to comply with legislative or
   regulatory requirements in any jurisdiction, prevent fraud, crime or
   other activity that may cause harm in relation to our products or
   services and to help us run our business. We may also use your
   information to tell you about products or services we think may
   interest you.
   How do we collect personal information?

   We collect most personal information directly from you. For example, we
   will collect your personal information when you apply for or use a
   product or service or talk to us in person or on the phone.
   We also collect information from you electronically. For instance, when
   you visit our website or whenever you apply for or access Westpac Group
   products and services electronically (see "Do we collect personal
   information electronically?").
   Sometimes we collect personal information about you from other people
   or organisations. This may happen without your direct involvement. For
   instance, we may collect personal information about you from:
     * other Westpac Group companies;
     * publicly available sources of information, such as public
       registers;
     * your representatives (including your legal adviser, mortgage
       broker, financial adviser, executor, administrator, guardian,
       trustee, or attorney);
     * your employer;
     * other organisations, who jointly with us, provide products or
       services to you;
     * commercial information service providers, such as companies that
       provide fraud prevention reports; and
     * insurers, re-insurers and health care providers.

   What laws require or authorise us to collect personal information?

   We are required or authorised to collect:
     * certain identification information about you by the Anti-Money
       Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) and
       Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Rules
       Instrument 2007 (No. 1);
     * your Tax File Number, if you choose to provide it, by the Income
       Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth);
     * if you have applied for credit or provide a guarantee, certain
       information about your financial position under the National
       Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth), and if you give us a
       mortgage security, certain identification information under
       property laws in some states and territories; and
     * certain information in relation to your application if you have
       applied for an insurance as required by the Insurance Contracts Act
       1984 (Cth).

   How do we hold personal information?

   Much of the information we hold about you will be stored electronically
   in secure data centres which are located in Australia and owned by
   either the Westpac Group or external service providers. Some
   information we hold about you will be stored in paper files. We use a
   range of physical and electronic security measures to protect the
   security of the personal information we hold. For example:
     * access to information systems is controlled through identity and
       access management;
     * employees are bound by internal information security policies and
       are required to keep information secure;
     * all employees are required to complete training about information
       security; and
     * we regularly monitor and review our compliance with internal
       policies and industry best practice.

   We take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify any
   personal information after it can no longer be used.
   Who do we disclose your personal information to, and why?

   We may share your personal information with other companies within the
   Westpac Group.
   We may also provide personal information about our customers to
   organisations outside the Westpac Group. To protect personal
   information, we enter into contracts with our service providers that
   require them to comply with the Privacy Act. These contracts oblige
   them to only use the personal information we disclose to them for the
   specific role we ask them to perform.
   Generally, we disclose personal information to organisations that help
   us with our business. These may include:
     * our agents, contractors and external service providers (for
       example, mailing houses and technology service providers);
     * authorised representatives and credit representatives who sell
       products and services on our behalf;
     * insurers, re-insurers and health care providers;
     * payment systems operators (for example, merchants receiving card
       payments);
     * other organisations, who jointly with us, provide products or
       services to you;
     * other financial services organisations, including banks,
       superannuation funds, stockbrokers, custodians, funds managers and
       portfolio service providers;
     * debt collectors;
     * our financial advisers, legal advisers or auditors;
     * your representatives (including your legal adviser, accountant,
       mortgage broker, financial adviser, executor, administrator,
       guardian, trustee, or attorney);
     * fraud bureaus or other organisations to identify, investigate or
       prevent fraud or other misconduct;
     * external dispute resolution schemes; and
     * regulatory bodies, government agencies and law enforcement bodies
       in any jurisdiction.

   We may also disclose your personal information to others outside the
   Westpac Group where:
     * we are required or authorised by law or where we have a public duty
       to do so;
     * you may have expressly consented to the disclosure or the consent
       may be reasonably inferred from the circumstances; or
     * we are otherwise permitted to disclose the information under the
       Privacy Act.

   Do we disclose personal information overseas?

   We may disclose your personal information to a recipient which is
   located outside Australia. This includes:
     * Westpac Group companies located in China, India, Singapore, New
       Zealand, United Kingdom, United States;
     * Westpac Group’s service providers which are likely to be located in
       New Zealand, Canada, United States, India, the Philippines, and
       China; and
     * for international transactions, such as currency exchanges, we may
       need to disclose your information to the corresponding
       international party in order to process the transaction. The
       countries we disclose your information to will depend on the
       details of the transaction you ask us to carry out.

   Do we use or disclose personal information for marketing?

   We will use your personal information to offer you products and
   services we believe may interest you, but we will not do so if you tell
   us not to. These products and services may be offered by a member of
   the Westpac Group or one of its preferred suppliers. We may offer you
   products and services by various means, including by mail, telephone,
   email, SMS or other electronic means , such as through social media or
   targeted advertising through Westpac Group or non-Westpac Group
   websites.
   We may also disclose your personal information to companies outside the
   Westpac Group who assist us to market our products and services to you.
   If you don’t want to receive marketing offers from us please contact
   us.
   Do we collect personal information electronically?

   We will collect information from you electronically, for instance
   through internet browsing, mobile or tablet applications.
