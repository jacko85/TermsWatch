Loyalty Programs

   Information on our Loyalty Program databases (including information
   about users of products and services available to members of our
   Loyalty Programs) is used for additional purposes to those outlined in
   the section titled 'How we use your personal information'.

   One of the primary purposes of these programs is to provide and market
   enhanced products and services to you, including the products and
   services of our partners and other third parties who we believe may
   have products and services in which you would be interested. Other
   purposes include assessing membership applications; awarding program
   points; confirming eligibility for and providing services associated
   with these programs; providing enhanced and personalised benefits and
   services; understanding your interests and hobbies to enhance your use
   of the programs; improving our services and customer service, including
   by means of research, behavioural analytics, product development and
   planning; and operational management of the programs.

   For these purposes, additional information is collected by us through
   your registration with, and participation in, the Loyalty Programs
   (including your application for, and use of, a Qantas Frequent Flyer
   linked credit card, Qantas Cash card or any other benefit). This
   additional information may include information such as country of
   residence, seating and other travel preferences, leisure and sports
   interests, and information about how you earn and use your points. This
   information may be collected from you directly or from third parties
   providing services for the Loyalty Programs or our program partners,
   such as when you register through one of our program partners or
   transact with them.

   In addition to the disclosures outlined in the section 'Disclosure of
   Information to Third Parties', Qantas may disclose this information to
   partner airlines, oneworld alliance airlines, and non-airline program
   partners for the purposes outlined above. The information may also be
   disclosed to any third party providing services for the Loyalty
   Programs (including products and services available to members),
   including assisting us in determining your eligibility for, and
   providing, these products and services, administering the programs,
   handling and processing membership applications and operating our call
   and service centres.

   If you are an employee travelling or obtaining other products or
   services in relation to one of our Qantas Business Rewards members, we
   may also collect information about your role with the member, your
   employment type, your employee number, your start date with the member
   and details of any employer paid travel arrangements. If you are
   travelling for work purposes on a ticket purchased by your employer, we
   may disclose your travel details and any information associated with
   your travel (such as incident reports) to your employer.

   When you are logged into your Loyalty Program account, Qantas may also
   keep logs of your use of qantas.com. This information may include date
   and time of visit, Loyalty Program membership number, membership
   status, surname, location and actions, for example, pages viewed and

   preferences and provide you with information about our products and
   services and our partners' products and services which we think may
   interest you. If you are a Loyalty Program member and are logged into

   personal information.

   from, and disclose your personal information to:
     * customer verification companies for ID checking and due diligence
       as required for all financial products;
